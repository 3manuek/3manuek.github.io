Who is this?

I'm Emanuel Calvo, a Database Architect and Consultant based in Buenos Aires,
Argentina. As a Lead Database Consultant for the Open Source Cluster at [Pythian][pythian]
, I manage technologies as MySQL and forks, MariaDB,
PostgreSQL, MongoDB, among others inside my team and across the organization within a strategic approach.

I gave several talks about PostgreSQL, MySQL and Redis in several countries: Canada (PGCon),
Belgium (FOSDEM), Argentina (PgDay and NoSQLMySQL Conference), Brazil (PGBR and PgDay Campinas),
United States (Percona Live 2016) and Spain (OSWC).

Worked as a PostgreSQL trainer for SIU, 2ndQuadrant and EnterpriseDB.
