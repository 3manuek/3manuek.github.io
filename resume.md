## Summary

Frequently, this section is full of easily searchable keywords that bots and humans anxiously
require to commit the inherited task of joining manpower to their organizations. Instead, I'm going 
to center the speech about where I'm standing right now.

I'm not actively looking any position, although I'm open to very specific projects and mostly related 
with analytics and building infrastructure for it. 

Since 2006, I've worked with a vast heterogeneous set of technologies and companies, from boutique 
services to large consulting firms, companies in the telco field bot for training, consulting and support.

I'm mostly focused on Open Source Databases/Datastores Reliability and Scalability and also, related technologies
for data manipulation from pipelines, streaming, workers and queues. I do manage daily several types of Cloud providers,
programming languages for tool developing and architecture design work.

_As a previous and totally unrelated experience, I worked at Federal Penitentiary Argentinian Force,
as officer in several institutions, from medium to high security._
